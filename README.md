This is the GitHub page that houses a Pokemon Learnsets table. The app can be found here: 

## About
Pokemon learn moves as they level up. But these moves change from generation to generation. They even change on a per game basis!

While websites exist that house this information, none of these sites are very convenient, often requiring you to click through multiple links to get the information you need. This web app, written in R, tries to make this more convenient by having all games readily available and including a search box.

**This project would not have been possible without the PokeAPI team's large resource database (see: https://pokeapi.co/). A big thank you to everyone who has contributed to that. If this interests you, please consider contributing to the project**

## Contributing
I made this project for two people (one of which was me), so the optimization isn't phenomenal. While I managed to get the code to run in around a minute, I'm sure more experienced R users know ways to make it even faster. If that sounds like you, please feel free to make a fork and pull request.
