# Some notes: Each gen adds to the last, i.e. gen 1 mons move sets are different than
# gen 1 mons in gen 2, etc. This is going to be an exponential amount of work

# Looking over some resources, I want data frames and to put them into tables
# Problem: multirow tables

# Pokemon data
# Gen 1 moves
gen_1_pokemon <- data.frame(
    Pokemon = c("Bulbasaur"),
)

# Gen 2 moves

# Gen 3 moves

# Gen 4 moves

# Gen 5 moves

# Gen 6 moves

# Gen 7 moves

# Gen 8 moves

# Gen 9 moves

# User interface

# Server

# calling shinyApp
